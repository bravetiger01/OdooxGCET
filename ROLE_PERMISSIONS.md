## Implementation Details

### Context API
The role-based permissions are managed through `AppContext.tsx`:

```typescript
const rolePermissions: Record<UserRole, string[]> = {
  Admin: ['*'], // Full access
  HR: ['view_dashboard', 'view_employees', 'add_employee', ...],
  Payroll: ['view_dashboard', 'view_employees', 'view_payroll', ...],
  Employee: ['view_dashboard', 'view_own_profile', 'apply_leave', ...],
};
```

### Permission Check
Use the `hasPermission()` function:

```javascript
const { hasPermission } = useApp();

{hasPermission('add_employee') && (
  <button>Add Employee</button>
)}
```

### Sidebar Menu
The sidebar automatically filters menu items based on user permissions:

```javascript
const menuItems = allMenuItems.filter(item => 
  hasPermission(item.permission)
);
```
